# eSMALT

Our lab has developed a lineage tracing system eSMALT, enabling simultaneous single-cell expression profiling and single-cell lineage tracing. Specifically, the 1-kb lineage barcode is designed as the 3’-UTR of RFP under the control of a strong promoter.  As such, single-cell RNA sequencing can simultaneously capture the endogenous transcripts and the 1-kb barcode transcript, revealing paired functional state and lineage information of the same cells.  Technically, the full-length of 1-kb lineage barcode should be amplified from single cell cDNA library and subject to PacBio sequencing. The resulting sequence data underwent CCS reads generation, mapping to reference, UMI reads consensus, UMI reads assigned to cell, cell barcode consensus. Finally, each cell generated a representative lineage barcoe sequence, and all cell barcodes were subjected to phylogeny reconstruction.
